VolunteerP - Donation Management System
Project Overview
VolunteerP is a digital platform designed to connect donors and recipients within communities,
facilitating anonymous and secure communication. This project addresses common challenges in donation management, 
such as privacy concerns and lack of accessibility, by creating a safe environment where users can offer or request assistance without exposing personal information.

Features:
Anonymous Communication: Users can choose to interact without revealing their personal information, ensuring privacy and security.
User Roles: The platform supports different roles, including Admin, Donor, and Recipient, each with tailored functionalities.
Post Management: Donors and recipients can create, update, or delete posts with details about donations or needs, and add images to illustrate items.
Comment System: Users can comment on posts, allowing for open discussions and clarifications.
Search Functionality: Recipients can search posts by keyword to quickly find specific items.
Technologies Used
Frontend: WPF with XAML for the UI, leveraging MVVM architecture for better separation of concerns.
Backend: .NET Core 3.1 and ASP.NET Core for server-side development, including data handling and business logic.
Database: MongoDB for data persistence, hosted on MongoDB Atlas for scalability and ease of management.
Development Tools: Visual Studio as the primary IDE for coding, debugging, and testing.
System Architecture
The project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation between the UI and the underlying logic. 
This structure allows for independent client and server-side development, making the application easier to maintain and scale.

Getting started:
Set Up Database: Configure MongoDB with the necessary connection details.
Run the Application: Open the solution in Visual Studio and start the project.
